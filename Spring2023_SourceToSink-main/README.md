### Final Release Product - Updated 5/9/2023
1. ***Overview***
    - Source to Sink watershed viewer allows Wisconsin residents to see how the water supply for their home or business may interact with watersheds at local/regional level. Groundwater and surface water systems are highly interrelated, and this tool helps to tell part of that story. A private well user or a municipal resident is able to search their address and find which watershed their neighborhood lies within. From there, the user can explore adjacent watersheds or see how their watersheds contribute to the rivers and streams of the state. This provides an enhanced perspective that contributes to a better understanding of Wisconsin's water resources.

2. ***Operation***
    - To use this webmap, it's as simple as clicking and dragging around the map. Simply hovering over the various watersheds will highlight the selected watershed and a popup in the bottom left of the screen will update with various information about the current watershed. Clicking on the watersheds will center the map on the selected watershed and display a popup in the bottom right to allow you to explore the upstream/downstream relationship between the ones around it. If looking for a specific watershed, just select it based on location! If you are unsure of which watershed your home is located in, use the search function in the top right to locate a specific location and click the containing watershed once you have found it. After finding your watershed, feel free to explore the other data layers in the layer selection menu in the top left. Here, you can see where your watershed is in relation to cities, a continental divide, and even larger watersheds. Don't know what these layers represent? Feel free to click the information icon next to each layer and explore what each layer represents. Have fun explopring the watersheds of Wisconsin!

### Final Proposal - Updated 4/12/2023
1. ***Persona/Scenarios***
    1. **Persona**
    - *Target User Profile: Kathy Jones, Conservation Planner - Dane County, WI*
        - User Background: Kathy is a conservation planner with Dane County, Wisconsin. She is concerned that urban sprawl may eventually put a strain on local water supplies. Since much of Wisconsin’s population relies on groundwater for drinking water and other purposes, aquifers and groundwater supply are important factors when planning municipal water systems. She would like to identify and delineate aquifers and watersheds that are the sources for specific addresses and hypothetical areas of suburban expansion. This would allow her to compare and rank aquifers/watersheds that are heavily accessed and identify areas that she may need to include in future groundwater modeling projects.
        Kathy also owns an acreage south of Madison along a small creek. This acreage has a private well that supplies water for Kathy’s family. She has noticed that after some rain events, water levels in the creek rise and sediment is present in water from her well.  Her neighbor’s well, 3000 feet to the west does not experience increased sediment after rain events. She would like to identify which aquifer and which surface watershed are connected to her well so she can understand what causes this phenomenon.

    2. **Scenarios**
        - *Scenario 1*: The user is a private well owner that knows the location of their private domestic well. Upon entering the interactive they are asked to either enter an address or select a point on the map. In this case the user selects the option to select a point on the map, and essentially drops a pin. By doing this, they are identifying their point of interest and retrieving aquifer and watershed information related to the well. They will also be able to overlay different features (watershed, surface water, aquifer) via a checklist of available layers on interactive. In this case, if the user wants to use the interactive for further exploration, they would be able to click a button to “view all” watersheds/aquifers. They can then hover over a polygon feature and retrieve watershed information of the feature.
        - *Scenario 2*: The user is a resident of Madison within city limits and on municipal water. Upon entering the page they enter their home address into the location search. A geocoder will link their address to a location within the city of Madison and display the municipal wells linked to the Madison municipal water system (and subsequently retrieve watershed info for that location). They would also be able to input a relative’s address who has a private well (independent of municipal system) and identify and delineate the watershed/aquifers of interest.
